# Installation and Configuration Guide

## üìã Prerequisites
Before starting with installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14.x or later) installed. You can download it from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm should be included with your Node.js installation.

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the Visual Studio Code repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.git
cd vscode
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install all necessary dependencies using npm. This will download and configure all required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Build the Project
To compile the project, run the build command with gulp:
```bash
npm run gulp build
```
**Note**: Building might take some time due to the size of the project.

### Step 4: Run Visual Studio Code

#### Option A: Development Mode
You can start Visual Studio Code in development mode using the following command. This will open a new instance of VS Code with your current project loaded:
```bash
code .
```

#### Option B: Standalone Mode
To run a standalone instance of Visual Studio Code:

1. Navigate to the `./out` directory.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   ./vscode-electron-sandbox --user-data-dir="./my-test-userdir"
   ```
This will start VS Code with your project settings applied.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure that you have sufficient disk space and memory for building the project, as it can be resource-intensive.
- If you encounter any issues during installation or configuration, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/developing-extensions) or open an issue on GitHub for further assistance.
