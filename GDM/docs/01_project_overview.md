# Project Overview

## üìã Introduction

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a highly popular, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is built using TypeScript and leverages modern JavaScript practices for performance and maintainability.

### Key Features:

- **Extensible Architecture**: VSCode supports a vast ecosystem of extensions to add functionality.
- **Integrated Tools**: Includes built-in terminal, debugging, Git integration, and more.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed with TypeScript and Electron frameworks.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrates with various APIs using RESTful services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the application by following platform-specific instructions:
   - **Windows**: Run the `.exe` installer and follow on-screen instructions.
   - **macOS**: Drag the `Visual Studio Code.app` to the Applications folder.
   - **Linux**: Use package managers (e.g., APT for Debian-based systems) or download the tarball from the website.
3. Launch VSCode and start a new project or open an existing one.

### Extensions:

To enhance functionality, install extensions via:
- **Extensions View**: Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar to search for desired plugins (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
- **Command Palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to manage extensions directly.
